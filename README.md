# Image Sequence Cleaner
Easilly clean up image sequences by sorting and mapping the sequence starting from zero.

Example:

An images sequence with files `1000.exr, 1002.exr, 1004.exr` will become `0.exr, 1.exr, 2.exr`

# Usage
Drop and drop an image sequence on main.py

OR

Open file and specify image sequence directory
